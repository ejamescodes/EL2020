# EL2020

Hello, and welcome to my (N03217280) github repository for the spring 2020 embedded linux class.  This repository will be used as an example of ways to maintain a code base while working on my project . This is **NOT** the Embedded Linux class itself.  That is hosted on Google Classroom.  Please contact "simonsj [at] newpaltz [dot] edu" if you are in the class, but do not have the classroom code.
